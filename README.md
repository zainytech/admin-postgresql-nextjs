# PostgreSQL with Prisma
Made this beginner project to learn how to perform basic CRUD operation in a relational database using admin panel.

### 🔗The admin panel can be accessed on localhost:3000/admin

## 🚶‍♀️Working
In this project only admin can decide which content should be shown on homepage of this website.
The content can be newly created, updated, deleted, or chosen to show on homepage only from admin panel.

## 🧰Tech Stack
- Built this project in `NextJS`
- Used `PostgreSQL` as my relational database.
- Used `Prisma` to write my SQL Queries for connecting with database.
- Used `TypeScript` for more maintainable development.
- Used `Custom Middleware` for secure authentication for Admin Panel.
